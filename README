Synergy and it's components are, unless otherwise

Synergy includes software developed by Eric Young (eay@cryptsoft.com)
and software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in the
OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/).
The OpenSSL toolkit is licensed under two BSD-style open-source
licenses: the OpenSSL License and the SSLeay License.
Full texts of both licenses can be found in the the

A source tarball is provided as the file
"./ext/mDNSResponder-765.20.4.tar.gz" for building the
Bonjour|mDNSResponder|dnssd.dll project required for Windows.
The majority of that project (referred to as Bonjour herein)
is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2 available from:
  <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>
To accommodate license compatibility with the widest possible range
of client code licenses, the shared library code, which is linked
at runtime into the same address space as the client using it, is
licensed under the terms of the "Three-Clause BSD License".
The LICENSE file of Bonjour is located within the tarball.
The tarball was retrieved from [here](https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/mDNSResponder/).



A detailed building guide isn't provided yet so the best
plan is to view the [wiki entry for building](https://github.com/symless/synergy/wiki/Compiling) in the
[symless/synergy](https://github.com/symless/synergy) repository.

And here's an excerpt on build from a previous version of the README.md
Just use "hm conf" and "hm build" to compile (./hm.sh on Linux and Mac).
